This is a copy of the NiCad clone detector with solidity parser, code extractors and normalizers. In addition, some python scripts for data extraction and visualization. 

The solidity grammar along with the relevant license can be found in the [txl/sol.grm](https://github.com/eff-kay/nicad6/blob/master/txl/sol.grm). 
The relevant solidity normalizers/extractors can be found at txl/sol*.txl

All of the files have been merged upstream and are part of the official NiCad (v6.2 onwards).
The latest release of NiCad can be found at https://www.txl.ca/txl-nicaddownload.html
