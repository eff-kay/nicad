Frequently asked questions:

1. What types of clones does NiCad detect?

    NiCad detects clone types 1-3.

    To detect type 1 (exact) clones, set threshold=0.0
    To detect type 2 (renamed) clones, set threshold=0.0 and rename=blind
    To detect type 2c (consistently renamed) clones, set threshold=0.0 and rename=consistent
    To detect type 3-1 (near-miss exact) clones, set threshold=0.3 
    To detect type 3-2 (near-miss renamed) clones, set threshold=0.3 and rename=blind 
    To detect type 3-2c (near-miss consistently renamed) clones, set threshold=0.3 and rename=consistent

    Predefined configurations for each of these NiCad configurations
    are in the config/ subdirectory.  Predefined configurations include
    type1, type2, type2c, type3-1, type3-2, type3-c, corresponding to the 
    options above.  

    For example, to detect only type 1 (exact) clones in the JHotDraw54b1 
    example system, use the NiCad command:

        nicad6 functions java examples/JHotDraw54b1 type1
   
    Note that results are inclusive, that is, type 2 includes type 1,
    type 3-1 includes type 1, and type 3-2 includes types 1 and 2.

2. What languages does NiCad handle?

    NiCad comes with plugins to handle C, Java, C#, Python, PHP, Ruby,
    Swift, ATL and WSDL, but can handle any language easily.

    Any other language L for which there is a TXL grammar can be
    added by creating simple "L-extract-functions.txl" and 
    "L-extract-blocks.txl" TXL programs to extract the corresponding 
    code fragments from an L program. 
 
3. What code fragment granularities can NiCad handle?

    NiCad comes with plugins to detect function (method) and block
    (compound statement) clones.

    Other granularities can easily be added by creating simple variants
    of the TXL extractor plugins for other code units.

4. What forms of output does NiCad produce?

    NiCad produces clone pairs in XML-like format specifying the
    source file and starting and ending line numbers of each original
    source fragment in the pair, for example:

        <clone nlines="42" similarity="100">
            <source file="EGsystem/EGfile1.java" startline="477" endline="529" pcid="596"></source>
            <source file="EGsystem/EGfile2.java" startline="417" endline="470" pcid="595"></source>
        </clone>

    If the NiCad configuration includes "report=yes", additional reports
    in both XML and browser-compatible HMTL web page form are produced
    with original source code for each fragment.

5. Can NiCad cluster clone pairs into clone classes?

    NiCad can optionally cluster clone pairs into clone classes by
    including "cluster=yes" in the configuration file.  Each clone class
    consists of the largest set of detected source fragments that are related
    to one another by at least one clone pair.
 
6. What normalization and other clone detection options does NiCad support?

    NiCad includes configuration options to customize clone detection 
    to filter (ignore) or abstract (treat as same) any part of the code.  

    For example, to ignore declarations, make a NiCad configuration 
    including "filter=declaration", or to treat all expressions as 
    equivalent, make a NiCad configuration including "abstract=expn".  
 
    Custom normalizations can be added to custom transform the code 
    in any way you wish before comparison using "normalize=mytransform", 
    where "mytransform.txl" is any TXL source transformation you wish
    to add.

7. Can NiCad find clones between two different systems?

    NiCad can detect cross-clones between two different systems
    using the command "nicad6cross", which reports only clones that
    cross between two different systems.

    If you require both clones inside the systems and between them,
    put the root source directory of both systems in a parent directory
    and use the regular "nicad6" command on that directory.
